# Administration-for-Software-Developers
Assignment 1 for ARP400
/* This application works in a way that you create employees who you then can keep as ordinary programmers,
 * or convert to either mentors or mentees. 
 * 
 * To create persistance between executions of the applications the records of the different types of employees are saved in XML files that the application reads from on execution.
 *  
 * Polymorphism has been used on all the different classes since the XML serializer needs parameterless constructors and the creation of objects needs a different constructor.
 * 
 * I chosed to use Generic Lists as my choice for a collection as they seemed to be the best choice for storing objects as i've done. However in retrospect i think
 * that i could have benefited more from using Dictionaries as i could have used their unique key value to keep things more organized.
